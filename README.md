# LTLTalk - Frontend 

LTLTalk is a system for instructing robots.
It starts with LTL as its underlying formal language, but enables its users to expand the language.
This repository contains a frontend of the system: a simple grid world in which a robot can collect items of different 
colors and shapes.
